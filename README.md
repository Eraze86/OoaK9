I have created a website for my sister as an exjob. 
My sister is a dog trainer on the side, and needed a site for all the information. I also thought she needed a bookingsystem, and an admin vue.
In the bookings, costumers can choose a course and then read more aboute it, choose a date with time, and fill in a form. Hit send and this creates the booking. It also send to backend -1 on avalible spots on that course and date.

In the admin yuo can se all the bookings and also handle what courses you whant. Add a course, the add dates and spots to that specifik course. Also change and delete. 
Bookings can aslo be deleted and changed. 
In admin you can also change the content of the first page, policy, private coaching and aboute site. Sometimes things need to be added or changed :)
The design is still under procces, getting some tusch ups from my sister. she has the last word of course
In contact and private coaching, when the form is filled and sent the costumer gets a mial with the information, and so do admin, witch is me for the moment.
